                <div class="text">
                       <p> I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? </p>

                        <h1> Assignments </h1>
                        
                        Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following: <br>
                        <p> <ul>
                        <li>Assignment 1</li>
                        <li>Assignment 2</li>
                        <li>All the rest of the assignments</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        
                        <h1> Lectures </h1>
                        
                        Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on Rate My Little Pony (<a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/">https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/</a>), and your ratings are pretty terrible.
                        
                        <h1> Course Website </h1>
                        
                        I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird.  Do you mind if I just ignore this part?
                
                        <p> I look forward to a fruitful semester. </p>
