            Erich Fromm (1900-1980) was a German social psychologist, psychoanalyst, and humanist philosopher. After the Nazi regime took over in Germany, Fromm left the country and finally settled down in the US in 1934.
        <br>
        Most of his publications explore the interactions between psychology and society and are strongly influenced by psychoanalytic concepts, Marxian social theory, and humanist ideas. Fromm was considered to be part of a Neo-Freudian school of psychoanalytical thought.
        <br>
        His work especially focuses on human qualities that are harmful for modern societies and explains how understanding basic human needs is essential in order to understand society as a whole. Concepts that Freud wants to explain through this perspective include the authoritarian personality, alienation, and religion. He also emphasized that freedom was a fundamental part of human nature and demonstrates both personal and societal consequences in case of its absence in his book "Escape from Freedom".

        These are some of his most influential works: <br> </p>
                <p>
                Escape from Freedom (1941) <br>
                Psychoanalysis and Religion (1950)<br>
                The Art of Loving (1965)<br>
                To Have or to Be? (1976)<br>
                </p>
        Fromm was member of the Frankfurt School (Frankfurter Schule), a school of social theory and critical philosophy associated with the Institute for Social Research, at Goethe University Frankfurt.
