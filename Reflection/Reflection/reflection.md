# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

Using semantic elements helps to structure and organize the webpage and thus make it easier to communicate meaning to the browser or developer. Even if semantic elements don’t directly contain web content, they are essential in order to differentiate elements on the webpage. This way, readers can distinguish between different kinds of data. Furthermore, through those elements presentation can be separated from content and a hierarchy can be established. It is also helpful, if you only want to change the styling of specific elements on your page.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.

Depending on the structure and representation of elements on the webpage, the reader’s experience can vary a lot. Changing the presentation can have an impact on how easy it is for the reader to find information on the webpage (e.g. the menu is usually on top of the page or on the side – putting it in the middle of the page might confuse the reader). Also, the presentation can affect the usability of a website, making it more user friendly, if the content is structured in a logical and clear way. Finally, the presentation might also have an impact on how the reader might interpret the content – if you present a picture next to some information, the reader expects a connection. But if the picture is presented on the opposite side of the page (or at the very bottom), the reader might not be able to draw the same conclusion.
